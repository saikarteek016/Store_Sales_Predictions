# Store_Sales_Predictions

Project Title: Forecasting Store Sales Data

Project Description:
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can forecast store sales data accurately. By analyzing historical sales data and relevant variables, the project aims to develop a robust forecasting system that assists store owners and managers in making informed decisions regarding inventory management, sales strategies, and resource allocation.

Key Steps and Components:

Data Collection: Gather historical store sales data from different stores or branches, including information about sales figures, date/time, product categories, promotions, weather conditions, and any other relevant variables that may impact sales.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Conduct feature engineering to extract relevant features and create new ones that might be useful in predicting sales.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform data visualization and statistical analysis to understand patterns, trends, and correlations within the sales data. EDA will provide insights that can guide the model selection and feature engineering process.

Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features that significantly influence sales. Utilize techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance, or dimensionality reduction methods to select the essential predictors.

Model Selection: Explore and compare various forecasting models, such as time series models (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet), machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks), or hybrid models that combine different approaches for improved accuracy.

Model Training: Split the dataset into training and validation sets. Train the chosen forecasting models on the training data and fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models' performance using appropriate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Select the model that provides the most accurate predictions.

Forecasting: Implement the selected model to forecast store sales data for a specific time period into the future. Visualize the forecasted results to understand the predicted sales trends.
